Design and simulation of a waveguide frequency meter with HFSS

## Description:
Frequency meters, also called "wavemeters", are what our grandparents used to determine the frequency of an unknown signal source. Engineers will fight tooth and nail to get the $100,000 spectrum analyzer in their setup. But one can obtain similar accuracy with a frequency meter. Waveguide frequency meters use a short circuit resonant cavity, which resonates at half-wavelength, to determine the frequency of a given signal. To understand exactly how they work, please refer to [1].

In this project, a waveguide frequency meter for the X band is designed and simulated with Ansys Electronics Desktop 2019 R3. The results of simulation are saved inside the simulation file; therefore, they can be observed even without running the analysis.
